**Academic Projects 
Arduino Programmer**                                                                                                                                               
I developed a program that ran on an Arduino microcontroller, which was connected to a computer through a PSOC. Using jumper wires and a USB connector, the setup interfaced with a digital LED display to print outputs. This project demonstrated my ability to integrate hardware and software, ensuring seamless communication between components.
TOOLS: Arduino, PSOC (Programmable System-on-Chip), Jumper Wires, USB Connector, Digital LED Display, C/C++

**Digital Logic Circuit**                                                                                                                                                     
I developed a logic circuit board that showcases both precision and dedication. It's designed as an educational tool to help teach digital electronics concepts. The soldering was done with great care and accuracy to avoid any future issues, ensuring the board remains reliable for hands-on learning.
TOOLS: Resistors, Light-Emitting Diodes (LEDs), 7-Segment Display, Integrated Circuits (ICs), DIP Switch, Variable Resistor (Potentiometer), Push Buttons (Pulsers), Capacitors, Logic Probes, Diodes.

**Breadboard Power Supply**

I created a breadboard power supply unit from scratch. I designed the circuit with voltage regulators for stable power output, capacitors for filtering, resistors for current limiting, and diodes for polarity protection. After finalizing the design, I prepared the PCB and carefully soldered each component, making sure to create clean and precise connections. I then connected the wires to the terminals and binding posts to provide power to the breadboard, thoroughly checking each connection to avoid any mistakes. Once everything was assembled, I tested the circuit using a multimeter to verify voltage levels and continuity, and used an oscilloscope to measure frequency and verify the circuit‚Äôs performance. 
TOOLS: Soldering iron, Multimeter, Oscilloscope, Wire stripper, Screwdriver, and drill

**Agile Issue Management using Jira**

Led the implementation of Agile workflows using Jira, managing sprint planning, task assignments, burndown charts, and stakeholder feedback loops.
Developed features with integration checks, documented APIs, and ensured compliance with performance and organizational standards.
Simulated deployment cycles with rollback procedures in test environments and conducted performance benchmarking and stress testing.
Collaborated with a team to deliver a sprint-ready system with full documentation, stakeholder sign-off, and deployment readiness.
Presented a live demo and technical report showcasing issue tracking, task management, and Freshdesk-style ticket resolution flow.
TOOLS: Jira, Agile Scrum framework, Confluence (documentation), Git (version control), Virtual test environment, Presentation tools (Google Slides/PowerPoint).
